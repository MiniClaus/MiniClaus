### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MiniClaus, another meme coin, is also trying to keep up with the competition. Currently, MiniClaus is said to be the latest yield generation token that rewards tokens to its holders. Moreover, it is also establishing a new standard of DeFi tokenomics and an innovative game-changing token distribution strategy. Here, every sell transaction in MiniClaus is taxed and is used to fund advanced solutions like automatic and manual buyback as well as adding liquidity in decentralized exchanges. Therefore, these elements, combined with experienced developers and influencers in the crypto space, will set up MiniClaus and push it to long-term growth.

MiniClaus has unique features like 5% redistribution in native tokens. This means 5% of every sell transaction will be automatically redistributed to all token holders. Meaning, holders donâ€™t have to claim their rewards because they will be delivered automatically to their wallets according to their MiniClaus holding proportion. Another notable feature is its 5% strategic buy-back & burn reserve. Here, the tokens collected from these fees are converted into BNB, which are locked and stored in the MiniClaus Contract.

Next is its 2% goes automatically to liquidity. The team explains that 2% of every transaction is sent to PancakeSwap for liquidity. Here, the projectâ€™s smart contract deposits 2% from every buy/sell transaction as MiniClaus and BNB into the liquidity pool. Simultaneously, 1% of every transaction is also allocated to fuel the projects in the ecosystem and also reward the active community.

SELL FEE 49% WILL BE REDUCED 10% EVERY WEEK FROM LAUNCH AND FINALLY TO ZERO â€˜0â€™ (THAT MEANS 49% FOR THE FIRST WEEK)
